# Hekima-RPG-Discord-Bot

Hekima RPG Discord bot is an upcoming project that I have been excited to make for about a month. It took roughly about 3 weeks 
of pure planning to make sure that I understood what was getting myself into, and to have a semi-detailed outline of what I was
going to be doing and what I was going to be needing. All my thoughts are in `game structure.txt` which will convey on how all 
my process of planning and current thoughts are on this project. This bot does not gain any income and is purely made for fun and 
learning pruposes.
